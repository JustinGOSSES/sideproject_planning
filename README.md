# sideproject_planning
side project planning to avoid just working on stuff

## More than ideas:
### Geoscience Related Projects
#### Continued improvements to my existing geoscience projects:
- Continue Predictatops Improvements????
  - maybe let this one stand as is given it's more useful as example than tooling.
- Wellio
  - Find files it doesn't work well on, identify solutions, submit issues/PR
- Wellioviz
  - Make improvements that remove issues
#### Contribute to existing geoscience community projects:
- awesome-open-geoscience: https://github.com/JustinGOSSES/awesome-open-geoscience
  - Manage approvals of contributions
- welly:
  - contribute pull requests that make it easier to exchange json between Welly and wellio
- pyrolite: Python for geochemistry
  - contribute a few issue fixes when have time
- Awesome-Earth-Artificial-Intelligence:  https://github.com/ESIPFed/Awesome-Earth-Artificial-Intelligence
  - Contribute linkages between it and Open-Awesome-Geoscience
- Potential future NLP & Geoscience project building on experience with geovec-playground repo???
  - idea

### Active Side Projects outside geoscience
#### Older Side Projects
- AR Business cards:
  - fix when dependencies cause it to break
- 404 page: 
  - done unless browser standards or street view syntax break it again
- Yi Yun's business site: https://yiyunlininteriors.com/

- SVG-based on Observable https://observablehq.com/@justingosses/svg-rectangles

#### Projects Around Community, Connections, & Dependencies
- SWUNG adaption on Lawrence Livermore National Labs software catalog project with emphasis on understanding engagement band ties across open source geoscience software landscape.
  - Clean last references to LLNL in code
  - write up list of changes needed to be done to reuse LLNL codebase
  - See if I can automate or fork LLNL codebase such that it's easier to reuse to understand other code communities

#### Blog Posts In Outline or Draft Stage
- Post about being featured creator on Observable
- Post about SWUNG hackathon on small technical products that help generate community

## Planning stages only
- CA
n you leverage this: https://github.com/nchah/github-traffic-stats and github actions to update front-end only website with traffic data of clones?
- planetary & geospatial notes for later projects : https://github.com/JustinGOSSES/planetary_geospatial_notes/blob/master/README.md
- AI ethics, risks, uncertainty linked concepts in document that forms web page https://github.com/JustinGOSSES/json_ld_risk_inside_documentation
- Houston (or any scale) kayaking analysis from geospatial data: https://github.com/JustinGOSSES/kayaking_geospatial_project
- side side project for kayak mapping project is visualization of NLP results of all houston canoe cloud trip reports: https://thcc.clubexpress.com/content.aspx?page_id=22&club_id=496051&module_id=164295
