# sideproject_planning
Side project planning to avoid just.... working on stuff

Current Most Active Projects Are:
- "VisualAwesome"... reusable visualizations of the community that comes from Awesome Lists.
- Water Related various....
  - A single page with all of the most common resources I check before paddling/surfing in Houston Galveston area. 
  - Exploration of state of the art of open source wave-related deep-learning with surf focus.


## Existing Longterm Side Projects:
### Geoscience Related Projects
#### Continued improvements to my existing geoscience projects:
- Continue Predictatops Improvements????
  - Maybe more clearly express in README that it is more of a proof of concept than tool? And provide more instructions for how to use as such?
- Wellio
  - Make improvements that remove issues
- Wellioviz
  - Make improvements that remove issues
  - 
#### Contribute to existing geoscience community projects:
- awesome-open-geoscience: https://github.com/JustinGOSSES/awesome-open-geoscience
  - Manage approvals of contributions
- welly:
  - contribute pull requests that make it easier to exchange json between Welly and wellio
- pyrolite: Python for geochemistry
  - contribute a few issue fixes when have time
- Awesome-Earth-Artificial-Intelligence:  https://github.com/ESIPFed/Awesome-Earth-Artificial-Intelligence
  - Contribute linkages between it and Open-Awesome-Geoscience

### Active Side Projects outside geoscience
#### Older Side Projects
- AR Business cards:
  - fix when dependencies cause it to break
- 404 page: 
  - done unless browser standards or street view syntax break it again
- Yi Yun's business site: https://yiyunlininteriors.com/
  - Done with adjustments as needed

#### Generative Art
- SVG-based on Observable https://observablehq.com/@justingosses/messing-around-with-a-fork-2342
- SVG-based on Observable https://observablehq.com/@justingosses/svg-rectangles
  - Build on this or start next one from scratch?



#### Blog Posts In Outline or Draft Stage
- Post about being featured creator on Observable
  - Too late?
- Post about SWUNG hackathon on small technical products that help generate community
    - Done


## Work In Progress Not Yet First Draft


#### Projects Around Community, Connections, & Dependencies
- <b>"VisualAwesome"</b> SWUNG adaption on Lawrence Livermore National Labs software catalog project with emphasis on understanding engagement band ties across open source geoscience software landscape.
  - write up list of changes needed to be done to reuse LLNL codebase
  - See if I can automate or fork LLNL codebase such that it's easier to reuse to understand other code communities
  - Would it be easier to reuse if it was just the python and JavaScript with no Jekyll/ruby?
- SWUNG hackathon lightning talk(s) slides
  - Done

#### Water Relatd
- Started markdown file with ideas for page that brings together all the sources I check for sea kayaking, whitewater paddling, flat water paddle boarding, and surfing. <a href="https://github.com/JustinGOSSES/sideproject_planning/blob/master/water_activities_dashboard_houston.md">https://github.com/JustinGOSSES/sideproject_planning/blob/master/water_activities_dashboard_houston.md</a>
  - And built <a href="https://github.com/JustinGOSSES/water_check_houston">little page with collection of iframes & visualizations</a> of frequently checked inforrmation sources before paddling.
- Observable notebook that uses USGS water guage API and personal experiences regarding when water is too high or fast for certain trips and plots the historical periods when trips were or weren't possible on a time series chart. 
- Exploration of state of the art of open source wave-related deep-learning with surf focus.

#### "AsBigAs" API
- A tiny javascript library that returns comparisons for length, height, area, volume, and weight based on data in JSONs or CSVs. For example, "The interior of the van has the same volume as 1523 average pineapples." draft in private repo https://github.com/JustinGOSSES/AsBigAs/blob/main/README.md

#### NASA Contractor Information Brain Dump
- A README with information related to getting a NASA contractor job. This consists of information I've told others in previous forms and some additional links to relevant information that I've gathered just for this side project. 
- repository: https://github.com/JustinGOSSES/nasa_contractor_jobs_information 


## Planning stages only
#### Geoscience
- Potential future NLP & Geoscience project building on experience with geovec-playground repo???
  - idea
- Interactive map & pictures of roadcut imagery from google streetview:
  -  Training machine learning model to detect road cuts or outcrops and then place on map with quality score that can use a frame of reference of either all data, regional data, or local data for quality of roadcut imagery cutoff. 


#### Generative Art 
- Generative objects using "how to draw" or "architecture of " references as inspiration. 
  - Suspect this is very hard approach???
  - Reference for leaves from paleobotanists https://twitter.com/JustinGinHou/status/1393271835442262018?s=19
  - Reference for how to draw bivalves: https://twitter.com/franzanth/status/1390613234382610432?s=19
  - Reference 1980s PDF on algorithmic beauty of plants: https://twitter.com/artnome/status/1396076937626497028?s=19

#### Blog Post Future
 - TBD

#### Geospatial
- Planetary & geospatial notes for later projects : https://github.com/JustinGOSSES/planetary_geospatial_notes/blob/master/README.md
- Houston (or any scale) kayaking analysis from geospatial data: https://github.com/JustinGOSSES/kayaking_geospatial_project
- Kayak mapping project is visualization of NLP results of all houston canoe cloud trip reports: https://thcc.clubexpress.com/content.aspx?page_id=22&club_id=496051&module_id=164295

#### Personal Website or Resume Related 
- Personal website revamp: https://justingosses.com
  - Need to migrate from WordPress to static site at some point!!!
- Resume Helper:
  - Organize bullet points from all past resumes into CSV / JSON. Use keywords, similar word bank, and basic logic rules on length and number of available lines to take in job description & job title and create starter resume for deeper human driven edits.
- Resume in decidedly not resume formats: 
  - Pick from list of X duties, list of Y skills, and a specific format choice and get back a resume in HTML format exportable to PDF.
  - Organize resume contents as graph of nodes. Nodes have links between nodes. Nodes have characteristics. Multiple different representations are possible based on representation of nodes, links, and node characteristics. Characteristics of each node include: skills, length, individual vs. group, individual contributor vs. leader, type of value to organization, numerical value, lists of resume style sentence to paragraph summaries of node, properties to filter last item.

#### Ideas Outside an Existing Category
- Can you leverage this: https://github.com/nchah/github-traffic-stats and github actions to update front-end only website with traffic data of clones?
